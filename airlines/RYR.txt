Program name: Ryanair Choice & Ryanair Family Plus / Business Plus

Ryanair Choice is a paid annual membership that gives benefits like free seat selection, fast track at selected airports, and 10% off checked bags for a fixed yearly fee. It’s focused on frequent flyers rather than a points-based system.
Ryanair Family Plus and Business Plus are fare bundles offering perks such as priority boarding, reserved seating, and flexibility on ticket changes. Ryanair does not operate a traditional mileage or tier-based loyalty program — instead, it emphasizes low fares and optional paid memberships for convenience and savings.
