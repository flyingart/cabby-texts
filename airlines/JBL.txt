Program name: TrueBlue

Members earn points on JetBlue flights and via partners (credit cards, etc.). Points never expire. There is a status called Mosaic, and a newer system using “Tiles” for tracking progress. Members can pick perks (“Perks You Pick”) as they accumulate tiles. Points can be redeemed for flights, and also for hotel/car packages now.
