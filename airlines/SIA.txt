Program name: KrisFlyer

Singapore Airlines’ loyalty program, KrisFlyer, lets members earn miles when flying with Singapore Airlines, Scoot, or Star Alliance partners. Miles can be redeemed for award flights, upgrades, and partner rewards. There are two main elite tiers — KrisFlyer Elite Silver and Elite Gold — plus the invitation-only PPS Club for premium cabin frequent travelers.
