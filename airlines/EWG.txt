Program name: Miles & More and Eurowings Boomerang Club

Miles & More is the Lufthansa Group’s main frequent flyer program, and Eurowings participates in it — members can earn and redeem miles on Eurowings flights as well as other Lufthansa Group and Star Alliance airlines.
Boomerang Club is Eurowings’ own independent loyalty program (separate from Miles & More). Members earn Boomerang Miles for flights and can redeem them for award tickets directly with Eurowings. It’s free to join and aimed at leisure travelers flying mainly within Europe.
