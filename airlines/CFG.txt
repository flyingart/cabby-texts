Program name: Miles & More

Condor also participates in Miles & More, allowing passengers to earn and redeem miles on Condor flights. Elite status members (Frequent Traveller, Senator, HON Circle) enjoy typical benefits such as priority check-in, baggage privileges, and lounge access depending on tier. Condor has no independent loyalty program separate from Miles & More.
