Program name: easyJet Flight Club & easyJet Plus

easyJet Flight Club is an invitation-only loyalty/recognition scheme for frequent flyers. Membership lasts one year, and is reviewed based on how often you fly; benefits are for the member and their immediate friends/family. 
easyJet Plus is a subscription-type membership that gives priority / fast-track services and additional perks (for example faster security, possibly better flexibility or boarding). Itâ€™s a paid benefit rather than a free points programme. (Note: easyJet does not have a traditional miles-based frequent-flyer points programme.)
